Update Git
===============================
Changed the code so the OpenAI key is saved in a standalone file "options.json", added to .getignore to prevent key leaking.
Added the new fields to "Add Model"
Change the mapping for prompts from hardcoded to use the project.json, like the "company_prompt" key. Now each prompt has it's own model to use. We also added a global "base_model" to override all models with the one set.
